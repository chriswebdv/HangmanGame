# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Java.

## Description

## Features

- Simple console-based interface
- Randomly selected secret word from a predefined list
- Feedback on correct and incorrect guesses
- Limited number of incorrect guesses before game over

## How to Play

2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the `Main` class to start the game.
4. Guess letters by entering them into the console when prompted.
5. Continue guessing until you either reveal the entire word or run out of guesses.
